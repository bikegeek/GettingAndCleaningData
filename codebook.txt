Code book for tidying the Samsung wearables data set


Study Design

The data used is accessible at:

Background information on wearables tracking:

Full description from the website where the data can be accessed:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Download the data from the above URL and store it in your working directory.
Unzip the file- you should get a UCI HAR Dataset directory which contains txt files: README.txt, activity_labels.txt, features.txt, features_info.txt and the directories test/ and train/, which contain the data on all subjects divided into a test and train data.

Copy the run_analysis.R script to the UCI HAR Dataset directory, so it can access the test/ and train/ directories, and the necessary txt files for generating column names.

Load the run_analysis.R script.  Run the script without any input parameters: run_analysis()

Instruction List
For running in RStudio, set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset* directory.  E.g. setwd(“/home/someusername/workingdir/UCI HAR Dataset”)

*Your operating system will dictate how the directory name will appear (after uncompressing the downloaded data).  For example, on Mac OS system, the unzipped file will produce a directory UCI HAR Dataset (spaces are preserved).

Make sure you have the rshape2 package installed, as the run_analysis.R script requires this for tidying the data.  Run install.packages(“rshape2”)
Code Book
Tidy data description:

A tidy.txt file is created by the run_analysis.R script applied to the above Samsung data.

The columns are: subject, activity, variable, value.

The subject is the number assigned to the subject (person) participating in the study.  There were 30 people involved in the study, and the subject numbers/identifiers range from 1-30.

The activity is a description of the activity in which the subject was engaged. An activity is one of the following: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying.

The variable corresponds to a measurement.  Measurments fall into one of the 17 categories:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag-XYZ
tGravityAccMag-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyroMag-XYZ
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccJerkMag-XYZ

'f'- denotes frequency domain data
't' – denotes time domain data
'XYZ' -denotes the x-, y-, and z- axis

Only the mean and standard deviation values were used to create the dataset.  The variables with names like tBodyJerk-mean()-X, tBodyJerk-mean()-Y, tBodyJerk-mean()-Z, tBodyJerk-std()-X, tBodyJerk-std()-Y, tBodyJerk-std()-Z, etc. were considered.

The names of the measurements are modifications of the label names used by the study, as defined in the test/y_test.txt and train/y_train.txt files.  The names were converted to lower case, with abbreviations expanded and names pre-pended with 'average', to reflect that the measurements were averaged.  Final measurement names look like the following:
 average-tbodyacceleration-mean-x
 average-tbodyacceleration-average-x
 
The values are derived/computed averages of the mean and standard deviation measurements described above.  Units are the sensor signals and unaltered from the Samsung data.
